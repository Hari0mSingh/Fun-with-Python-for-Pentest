# The provided script demonstrates how to use the yara Python library to compile a YARA rule and scan a string for matches against that rule

# Additional Notes
# YARA Rule Syntax: YARA rules can be more complex than the example shown. They can include multiple strings, conditions, and metadata to define specific patterns for detection.
# Performance: YARA is known for its efficiency in scanning large datasets for specific patterns defined in its rules.
# Integration: YARA is widely used in malware analysis, threat hunting, and intrusion detection systems (IDS) due to its flexibility and powerful pattern matching capabilities.


import yara

# YARA rule definition
rule = """
rule example {
    strings:
        $a = "Hello"
    condition:
        $a
}
"""

# Compile the YARA rule
compiled_rule = yara.compile(source=rule)

# Scan a string for matches against the compiled rule
matches = compiled_rule.match(data='Hello, world!')

# Print matches found
print(matches)
